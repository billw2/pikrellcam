# This is an example on_motion_begin script that reads the file
# /run/pikrellcam/motion-events and prints motion event types as they occur.
# Use it as a start for a custom script.
# Copy this script to say ../scripts/motion_events
# and then in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf, set on_motion_begin to:
#
#	on_motion_begin $C/motion_events $e
#
# This script as is just prints output which can be seen only if pikrellcam
# is run from a terminal.

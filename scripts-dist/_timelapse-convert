# Note: as of PiKellCam version 2.1.9, timelapse-end is obsolete.  It was
#   renamed to timelapse-convert and modified to generate timelapse thumbnails.
#
# Script to run commands on timelapse files when a timelapse is ended.
# This script is configured to run in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf
# and the default is to run this in the scripts-dist directory:
#   timelapse_convert $c/_timelapse-convert $m $T $n $G $P $l
#
# To customize this script, do not edit it in the scripts-dist directory.
# Copy it to timelapse-convert (or any name) in the scripts directory, edit
# it, and change the configuration in pikrellcam.conf to:
#   timelapse_convert $C/timelapse-convert $m $T $n $G $P $l
#
# Argument substitution done by PiKrellCam before running this script:
#   $C - scripts directory so this script is found.
#   $m - the media directory full path
#   $T - the timelapse video filename full path output name.  The path puts the
#        video in the video directory.
#   $n - the timelapse series just ended printed as %05d.
#   $G - log file configured in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf.
#   $P - the command FIFO full path.
#   $l - the timelapse temporary file name format suitable for use with avconv.
#        PiKrellCam uses a temporary file name format of tl_$n_$N.jpg.  So if
#        for example the just ended timelapse series is 22, the timelapse temp
#        files in the timelapse subdir will be: tl_00022_xxxxx.jpg where xxxxx
#        will be the sequence numbers for the timelapse snapshots.
#        In this case the $l variable will be:  tl_00022_%05d.jpg.
#        WARNING: Since a '%' is embeded in the string, the $l must be the
#        last variable given in the timelapse_convert string.
